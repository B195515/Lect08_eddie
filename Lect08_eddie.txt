Eddie	each computer is a node

Cores	processing unit in the computer - eddie has ~8000 (16-40 per node)

RAM	Each eddie node has from 64GB-3TB

Gridenginge	system that organizes/queues the usage requests to maximize resource use

Scientific linux

IGMM	Inst of Genetics and Cancer

Roslin Institute	

Memory per core	Total memory/ number of core x 2

Advantages	computational time and memory
	parallelization
	task division
	large storage memory (chunks rather than importing smaller portions)




Workflow	submit/head/login node

submit jobs by queue
	(qsub)
interactive work in a node
	(qlogin) - small tasks, testing
administrative work, checking 
	(qstat)

## "scratch" space
	20-50TB not backed up, 2TB per person, files deleted after a month
	/exports/eddie/scratch/s2255686/
	copy dataset to scratch space
	complete your analysis
	copy your results elsewhere


## Moving data from bioinfmsc5/7 to Eddie
	scp [file to copy] [destination]
	MUST BE DONE FROM WITHIN BIOINFMSC SERVER

to	scp file1 s2255686@eddie.ecdf.ed.ac.uk:/home/s2255686
to	scp file1 s2255686@eddie.ecdf.ed.ac.uk:/exports/eddie/scratch/s2255686/
from	scp s2255686@eddie.ecdf.ed.ac.uk:/exports/eddie/scratch/s2255686/file1 ./
dir	scp -r folder1/ s2255686@eddie.ecdf.ed.ac.uk:/home/s2255686

	MOVING WITHIN EDDIE to elsewhere
from	scp /localdisk/data/BPSM/Lecture09/Test_dataset.fa s2255686@eddie.ecdf.ed.ac.uk:/home/s2255686




## Interactive sessions
start
	(qlogin)
stopping session
	(exit)
indicate what you need
	qlogin -pe sharedmem<NUMBEROFCORES> -l h_vmem=<MEMORYPERCORE>
move from eddie to elsewhere
	qlogin -q staging
	use (cp) or (mv) as usual
usual workflows...
	stage data from elsewhere to Eddie > analyse data on Eddie > stage results back to elsewhere
within scripts
	can stage from within scripts allows for automation and make staging be part of the program
see cluster activity
	(top)
	(module load htop)	(htop)
sourcing script
	(source) OR (.)
login node - simple work only!!
submit a job
	qsub

	qdel [job id or job name]
get info on job
